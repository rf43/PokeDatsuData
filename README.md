# PokeDatsuData
A Dart library to obtain data from PokeAPI and provide it in an easily digestible format which a consuming application can use.

## Installation

At a minimum, you must have the 3.x version of Dart SDK installed on your system.

You can either install Dart directly by following [these instructions](https://dart.dev/get-dart) to install the Dart SDK
or if you plan to install Flutter on your system, you can follow [these instructions](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to install the Flutter SDK



_Note: Flutter includes the Dart SDK, therefore if you have Flutter installed there is no need to install the Dart SDK_
